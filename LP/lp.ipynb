    " $240 for excavator B, and $520 for excavator C. Do it using an integer programming model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Objective: Minimize the explotation costs\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **Branch & Bound** to minimize the explotation costs and determine the quantity of each type of excavators used.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The method consists of combining systematic exploration of the solution space with techniques to significantly reduce the number of solutions that need to be explored.\n",
    "The problem is represented as a decision tree. Each node of the tree corresponds to a partial sub-solution or a division of the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n",

    "20 x_{AIV} + 23 x_{BIV} + 31.5 x_{CIV} \\geq 220 \\quad \\text{(Type IV job demand)}.\n",

    "Limit on the number of excavators available:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{j} x_{Aj} \\leq 10 \\quad \\text{(Type A excavators availables)}.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Iterative Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Solve the Relaxed Problem** \n",
    "The initial problem is solved using the CBC solver, which finds an optimal solution. However, the solution may contain fractional values for some decision variables. This means that some excavators are assigned in fractional numbers, which is not allowed in the real-world scenario.\n",
    "2. **Check for Integer Feasibility** \n",
    "If all variables are integers, the solution is feasible, and the algorithm terminates with the current solution.\n",
    "If some variables are fractional, the solution is not feasible, and the algorithm branches.\n",
    "3. **Branching** \n",
    "Branching involves splitting the problem into two subproblems by fixing one fractional variable to: its lower bound (floor value) and its upper bound (ceil value). These new constraints create two subproblems that are added to a stack for further exploration.\n",
    "4. **Bounding** \n",
    "For each subproblem: solve the subproblem using the CBC solver, calculate the objective value (total cost) and compare the it with the current best cost. If the cost is worse than the current best, the subproblem is discarded. If the cost is better, the solution is kept as the current best solution. If the subproblem is infeasible (violates constraints), it is also pruned.\n",
    "5. **Iterate Until All Subproblems Are Explored** \n",
    "6. **Return the Optimal Solution** \n",
    "When all subproblems have been explored or pruned, the algorithm returns: the minimum total cost and the assignment of excavators to tasks that achieves this cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is a powerful approach as it provides optimal solutions, trying to reduce the computational effort needed by focusing only on the most promising solutions. It avoids the need to explore all possible solutions, although it can still be computationally expensive on problems with large solution spaces.\n"
